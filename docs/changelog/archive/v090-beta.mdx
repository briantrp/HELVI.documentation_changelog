## Release Notes - February 22, 2026

We've pushed a critical update to the Collabase Enterprise Platform, focusing on security, high-fidelity exports, and infrastructure stability.

### 🛡️ Security Patch: Nanoid Upgrade
- **Transitive Safety**: Implemented `overrides` in `package.json` to ensure even nested dependencies like `@excalidraw/excalidraw` and `postcss` use the secure version.


### 🛠️ Build & Infrastructure Stability
- **Next.js Prerendering Fix**: Successfully resolved the `useSearchParams()` bailout by wrapping the dashboard in a global `<Suspense>` boundary.
- **Admin Dashboard Reliability**: Applied `force-dynamic` to all admin routes to ensure production consistency.
